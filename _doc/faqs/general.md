### *&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-question-circle} Can I use the Realtime Mesh Component in a commercial project?

{: .answer}
Yes! The Realtime Mesh Component is governed by the MIT license, so you're basically unrestricted in use. All that is requested is that you provide credit when and where possible back to this project!

You can view the [License](/legal.html) for more detailed information!

### *&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-question-circle} How can I support the Realtime Mesh Component?

{: .answer}
The RMC is a labor of love kind of project, but unfortunately that doesn't pay the bills!

I am available for contract work, especially within Unreal Engine, whether that's directly related to the RMC or not. 

I do also do paid extension development to the RMC, and have on occasion taken on donnor sponsored upgrades to the RMC. In this case the rates will be dependant on whether it will be owned by you, or integrated to the RMC, and the nature/timeframe of the extension/upgrade. [Contact Me!](mailto:chris@koderz.io) about your needs!
